**Hello!** ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hami, fresh out of Aotearoa's cooking pot for aspiring Devs, "Dev Academy".

I have a desire to build things that add value to the world, which can be seen in my works found on my profile, such as:

New tech introduced: Tailwind, React, TypeScript, SQLite, and Express to create custom hooks, complex forms, APIs, CRUD functions, user experiences, and more.

New tech introduced: React Native to create my first mobile application. I am also learning Xcode to develop in a mobile environment.

**Proyo** (in progress)
