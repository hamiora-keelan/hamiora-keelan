# **Hello!** ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hami, fresh out of Aotearoa's cooking pot for aspiring Devs, [Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz).

I have a desire to build things that add value to the world, which can be seen by the work found on my profile, such as:

## **[Coordinary](https://github.com/hamiora-keelan/coordinary)**
A gift registry for charities.

**New tech introduced**: Tailwind, React, TypeScript, SQLite, and Express to create custom hooks, complex forms, APIs, CRUD functions, user experiences, and more.

## **[Lingobo](https://github.com/hamiora-keelan/lingobo)**
A language sharing community.

First personal project: included an attempt at making my own auth before I had learned about auth providers.

## **[Yumplug](https://github.com/your-profile/yumplug)** (in progress)
An app aiming to create vibrant urban areas.

**New tech introduced**: React Native to create my first mobile application. I am also learning Xcode to develop in a mobile environment.

## **[Proyo](https://github.com/hamiora-keelan/proyo)** (in progress)
A platform seeking to put fun back into professionalism.

**New tech introduced**: MongoDB to create a hybrid database common in social media.
